This project is a text-based terminal designed for simple instructions! It's meant to lie simply as a terminal on a screen to be left alone for as long as needed.

It includes the ability to move a coordinate forwards or backwards, and leave messages along the coordinates. 

To run the Deep_Terminal, just create a Terminal object and run it. (Check main for reference)
