This program is a text-based terminal that relies on the functionality of a 'gear-like' coordinate system. (check the gear demo out to get a better idea)

The coordinate system is built to function like a manual clock in which you, or the user, is able to progress it forwards or backwards and the system is built upon the span of the observable universe's radius!

This program is meant to be built upon by any who want. The idea is simply that you go to the 'baseTerminal_class.py' to get an idea of how to build a command for the terminal. It is suggested you try and come up with some cool commands that funciton with the coordinate system, but it's not required.

* To get started:
    1. Go to the baseTermianl_class.py file and get an idea of the functionality (guidance will be available on the file)
    2. To get a better reference of the complexity of the actual terminal, checkout the actual 'Deep_Terminal.py' file within the TerminalCode directory.
    3. The idea is to build commands that function with spacetime coordinates that function across the universe. Each 'tick' or 'forwards' represents 1 lightyear traversal across the observable universe's radius.
    4. I'm guessing you're part of deep, so if you come up with a cool command email me at: etvan13@tamu.edu (school) or etvan13@gmail.com (personal) your idea or code and I'll implement it into the actual terminal itself
