This program is a text-based terminal that relies on the functionality of a 'gear-like' coordinate system. (check the gear demo out to get a better idea)

The coordinate system is built to function like a manual clock in which you, or the user, is able to progress it forwards or backwards and the system is built upon the span of the observable universe's radius!

This program is meant to be built upon by any who want. The idea is simply that you go to the 'baseTerminal_class.py' to get an idea of how to build a command for the terminal. It is suggested you try and come up with some cool commands that funciton with the coordinate system, but it's not required.

* To run:
    1. Install the dependencies from 'requirements.txt': 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
    2. Go into the TerminalCode directory: 'cd TerminalCode'
    3. run 'main.py' using a python script: 'python3 main.py' or 'python main.py'
        * Note: This runs the main terminal. If you want to test your code with the base terminal skip step 2

* To add new commands:
    1. Go into the baseTerminal_Class.py file and understand how it functions. (Guidance will be available on the file)
    2. Create a new command utilizing the 'skeleton class'
    3. Add the new command to the list of commands in the terminal class, and add the function that runs your newly added demo.
        * To get a better reference on the complexity of the actual terminal, checkout the 'Deep_Terminal.py' file within the TerminalCode directory.
        * The idea is to build commands that function with spacetime coordinates that function across the universe.
    4. I'm guessing you're part of deep, so if you come up with a cool command email me at: etvan13@tamu.edu (school) or etvan13@gmail.com (personal) your idea or code and I'll implement it into the actual terminal itself
