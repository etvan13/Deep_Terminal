# Program Overview

This program is a text-based terminal that utilizes a unique 'gear-like' coordinate system. To understand how it functions, check out the **gear demo**.

The coordinate system is akin to a manual clock but extends over the span of the observable universe's radius. Users can progress this system forwards or backwards.

## Intended Use

This program is open for further development. Start by exploring `baseTerminal_class.py` to understand how to create commands for the terminal. While it's not mandatory, you're encouraged to develop innovative commands that leverage the coordinate system.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python and pip installed on your machine. You can verify your installation with:
```bash
python --version
pip --version
```
### Installation

1. Install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Navigate to the TerminalCode directory:
```bash
cd TerminalCode
```

3. Run `main.py`:
```bash
python main.py
```
**Note:** This command launches the main terminal. If you're testing your code with the base terminal, skip step 2.

## How to Contribute

### Adding New Commands

1. Open the `baseTerminal_Class.py` file and familiarize yourself with its functionality.
2. Create a new command using the 'skeleton class'.
3. Integrate your new command into the terminal class's command list and implement the function that runs your demo.
- For a deeper understanding of the terminal's complexity, see `Deep_Terminal.py` in the TerminalCode directory.
- Aim to design commands that interact with spacetime coordinates across the universe.

### Feedback and Contributions

If you come up with an idea you'd like to incorporate into the terminal, let me know!
