# Program Overview

This program is a text-based terminal that utilizes a unique 'gear-like' coordinate system. To understand how it functions, check out the **gear demo**.

The coordinate system is akin to a manual clock but extends over the span of the observable universe's radius. Users can progress this system forwards or backwards.

## Intended Use

This program is open for further development. Start by exploring `baseTerminal_class.py` to understand how to create commands for the terminal. While it's not mandatory, you're encouraged to develop innovative commands that leverage the coordinate system.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python and pip installed on your machine. You can verify your installation with:
```bash
python --version
pip --version
Installation
Install the necessary dependencies:
bash```
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Navigate to the TerminalCode directory:
bash
Copy code
cd TerminalCode
Run main.py:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
Note: This command launches the main terminal. If you're testing your code with the base terminal, skip step 2.
How to Contribute
Adding New Commands
Open the baseTerminal_Class.py file and familiarize yourself with its functionality.
Create a new command using the 'skeleton class'.
Integrate your new command into the terminal class's command list and implement the function that runs your demo.
For a deeper understanding of the terminal's complexity, see Deep_Terminal.py in the TerminalCode directory.
Aim to design commands that interact with spacetime coordinates across the universe.
Feedback and Contributions

### Markdown Formatting Tips:

- **Headings**: Start a line with `#` followed by a space for a heading. More `#` symbols indicate a sub-heading (smaller heading). For example, `### This is a heading level 3`.
- **Bold**: Enclose text in double asterisks `**` for bold text. Example: `**this text will be bold**`.
- **Code and Commands**: Use backticks `` ` `` to format text as inline code. For blocks of code or commands, use triple backticks ``` before and after the block.

This structure should help make your README more engaging and easier to follow!
