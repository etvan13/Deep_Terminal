1. Implement formulas customizable to manipulate coordinates. 
   * Maybe having a way to input a formula for #s g1 - g6 (gear 1 through gear 6)
   * Possibly the option to choose to arrive at a coordinate (basically portaling)
    - The idea here is to have a way for the user to change the current coordinate 
    in some way other than just incrementing forwards and backwards!

2. Fix the confirm choice for leaving a message 
    * It's too easy to double click 'enter' on accident & lose what was typed
    * In 'input' class, fix the fact that 'anything other than CONFIRM' is cancel, should just loop
    


(simplified version of what was lost): 

"TERMINAL_HELP"
    
    The use of coordinates helps to establish
    'moments' in spacetime. Any form of #s
    aligned in some way is due to some change
    in alignemnt (interactions). So, leaving
    messages across these coordinates connects
    a 'here' and 'then'. (sender & possible_reciever)


The goal is to creatively and scientifically accurately create different connections
between active coordinate sharers: The moment this is created and the moment you observe.
